# BigStrawberry

 This project is about building a fully functional web application using Ruby on Rails framework. The idea of the web app is to provide a useful and entertaining platform for discovering, sharing, and voting great cooking recipes. The recipes grouped by categories and can be created, edited, and deleted by the author. In the homepage, you can see:
- The featured post on the first row, taking the full width. The featured post is the recipe with the biggest number of votes given by users.
- The categories of the meals on the navbar and under the featured post. Categories link to the page of recipes according to category.

The authentication system is very simple and only requires `Username` credentials. Users can create an article by clicking the `Add New Recipe` button on the home page. She can see the list of articles created by herself by clicking on the `Username` link which is at the rightmost side of the navbar. The articles can be edited and deleted by the author using icons under the recipes. You can vote for the recipes and help to move it to the featured banner.

## Getting Started

To get a copy clone this repo to your local environment:

`git clone https://github.com/8Bts/Big_Strawberry'

## Prerequisites
- In order to make the program work, you need to have ruby interpreter installed in your system. You can get the latest version of ruby from [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
Ruby works better on the Linux OS but you can use other systems using bridging tools.

- This application uses [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) service to store it's images. So you need to have a Cloudinary account and you need to connect your app to it. Check [Setup](#Setup) to see how to do it.
  
## Setup

Instal gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

```
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

Connect with Cloudinary:


1. run `bundle exec figaro install` command and you will get `config/application.yml` file which is automatically added to your .gitignore list.

2. Open that file and add your Cloudinary credentials there.
  (You can get your credentials from [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console/))

Example:

```
# config/application.yml

cloud_name: "my_cloud"
api_key: "7381a978f7dd7f9a1117"
api_secret: "abdc3b896a0ffb85d373"
```
