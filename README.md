# BigStrawberry

 This project is about building a fully functional web application using Ruby on Rails framework. The idea of the web app is to provide a useful and entertaining platform for discovering, sharing, and voting great cooking recipes. The recipes grouped by categories and can be created, edited, and deleted by the author. In the homepage, you can see:
- The featured post on the first row, taking the full width. The featured post is the recipe with the biggest number of votes given by users.
- The categories of the meals on the navbar and under the featured post. Categories link to the page of recipes according to category.

The authentication system is very simple and only requires `Username` credentials. Users can create an article by clicking the `Add New Recipe` button on the home page. She can see the list of articles created by herself by clicking on the `Username` link which is at the rightmost side of the navbar. The articles can be edited and deleted by the author using icons under the recipes. You can vote for the recipes and help to move it to the featured banner.
